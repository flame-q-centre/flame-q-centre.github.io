# Introductory Python Tutorial (Beta version)

### By Nandini Gandhi and Oom Rawat

## Background

Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used worldwide in a wide variety of domains. While there exist many resources for learning Python - on Youtube, Coursera, EdX, Udemy to name only a few widely used platforms - these resources are mainly tailored for those who aim to become professional programmers. However, there esists a large community at FLAME University which is interested in Python mainly as a tool for manipulating and visualizing data. We believe that many commonly used Python resources are too detailed and technically oriented to hold the interest of this community. In this tutorial, we aim to introduce the essential features of Python that will allow users in non-CS disciplines to use Python for data-related tasks.  **This tutorial will be helpful for the CSIT102, STAT222, DMAC221 courses, among others at FLAME.**
